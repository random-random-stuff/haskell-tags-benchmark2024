This package provides collection of various tools for numeric
computations. Namely:

 - Number pure haskell implementations of special function which are used in
   statistical and numerical computing.

 - Compensated summation (Kahan summation) which allows to

 - Root finding for functions of single real variable

 - Series summation

 - Functions for comparing IEEE754 numbers

Where possible, we give citations and computational complexity
estimates for the algorithms used.
