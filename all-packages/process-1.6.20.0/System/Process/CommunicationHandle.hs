-- | A version of 'readCreateProcessWithExitCode' that communicates with the
-- child process through a pair of 'CommunicationHandle's.
--
-- Example usage:
--
-- > readCreateProcessWithExitCodeCommunicationHandle
-- >   (\(chTheyRead, chTheyWrite) -> proc "child-exe" [show chTheyRead, show chTheyWrite])
-- >   (\ hWeRead -> hGetContents hWeRead)
-- >   (\ hWeWrite -> hPut hWeWrite "xyz")
--
-- where @child-exe@ is a separate executable that is implemented as:
--
-- > main = do
-- >   [chRead, chWrite] <- getArgs
-- >   hRead  <- openCommunicationHandleRead  $ read chRead
-- >   hWrite <- openCommunicationHandleWrite $ read chWrite
-- >   input <- hGetContents hRead
-- >   hPut hWrite $ someFn input
-- >   hClose hWrite
