# Welcome to aeson-pretty

This is a JSON pretty-printing Haskell library compatible with [aeson](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson) as well as a command-line tool to improve readabilty of streams of JSON data.

The **library** provides a single function `encodePretty`. It is a drop-in replacement for aeson's `encode` function, producing JSON-ByteStrings for human readers.

The **command-line tool** reads JSON from stdin and writes prettified JSON to stdout. It also offers a complementary "compact"-mode, essentially the opposite of pretty-printing.
