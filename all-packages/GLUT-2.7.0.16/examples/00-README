This directory contains OpenGL example programs from various sources:

   * BOGLP: Contains some examples from the book "Beginning OpenGL Game
     Programming", 2nd ed., by Benstead/Astle/Hawkins.

   * Misc: Contains a few random examples from e.g. the Mesa sources.

   * OrangeBook: Contains an example from the book "OpenGL Shading Language",
     3rd ed, by Rost/Licea-Kane/Ginsburg/Kessenich/Lichtenbelt/Malan/Weiblen.

   * RedBook4: Contains all examples from the book "OpenGL Programming Guide:
     The Official Guide to Learning OpenGL, Version 1.4", 4th ed., by
     Shreiner/Woo/Neider/Davis.

   * RedBook8: Contains various examples from the book "OpenGL Programming
     Guide: The Official Guide to Learning OpenGL, Version 4.3", 8th ed., by
     Shreiner/Sellers/Kessenich/Licea-Kane.

If you have 'make' and 'ghc' installed, you can just issue 'make' at any
directory level to compile the examples. 'make clean' cleans up afterwards, and
you can use '-j [N]' for parallel builds. Directly loading the examples into
e.g. ghci is possible, too, just ':load' an example and run it via 'main'. For
some examples, you might have to extend the search path like '-i../common', see
the corresponding Makefile.
