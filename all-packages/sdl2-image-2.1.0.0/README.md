Haskell bindings to SDL2_image. Provides both raw and high level bindings.

The
[original SDL2_image documentation](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/docs/SDL_image.html)
can also help, as the bindings are close to a direct mapping.

##### Example

A small example executable is included with the library. It loads and displays
a given image. You can find it in the `example` directory.

```bash
stack exec -- sdl2-image-example
```
