-- | When lines are represented as Plücker coordinates, we have the
-- ability to check for both directed and undirected
-- equality. Undirected equality between 'Line's (or a 'Line' and a
-- 'Ray') checks that the two lines coincide in 3D space. Directed
-- equality, between two 'Ray's, checks that two lines coincide in 3D,
-- and have the same direction. To accomodate these two notions of
-- equality, we use an 'Eq' instance on the 'Coincides' data type.
--
-- For example, to check the /directed/ equality between two lines,
-- @p1@ and @p2@, we write, @Ray p1 == Ray p2@.
