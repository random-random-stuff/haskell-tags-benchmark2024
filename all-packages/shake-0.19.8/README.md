Shake is a tool for writing build systems - an alternative to make, Scons, Ant etc. Shake has been used commercially for over five years, running thousands of builds per day. The website for Shake users is at [shakebuild.com](https://shakebuild.com).

#### Documentation

* **Why use Shake?** Shake lets you write large robust build systems, which deal properly with generated source files and run quickly. If you are writing a custom build system of any moderate size (more than a few rules) you should use Shake. The advantages over other build systems are detailed in the document [Why choose Shake?](https://shakebuild.com/why).
* **How do I use Shake?** Shake is a Haskell library that you use to define your rules. The [Shake manual](https://shakebuild.com/manual) provides a walk through of a small but realistic example, assuming no Haskell knowledge.
* [Generated documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/shake/latest/doc/html/Development-Shake.html) for all functions, includes lots of examples.
* [Blog posts](https://neilmitchell.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/shake) detailing ongoing development work.
* [Academic paper](https://ndmitchell.com/downloads/paper-shake_before_building-10_sep_2012.pdf) on the underlying principles behind Shake.
