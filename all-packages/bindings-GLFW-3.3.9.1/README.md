bindings-GLFW
=============

## Description

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/bindings-GLFW.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bindings-GLFW)

Low-level [Haskell][1] bindings to [GLFW][2], an open source, multi-platform
library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts and managing input and
events.

The binding is to [GLFW 3.3.9 released 2023-12-13][3].

*These bindings are a lot lower level than intended for normal use.*
For higher-level GLFW bindings, see [GLFW-b][4].
