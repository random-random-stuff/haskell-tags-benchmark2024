## conduit

`conduit` is a solution to the streaming data problem, allowing for production,
transformation, and consumption of streams of data in constant memory. It is an
alternative to lazy I\/O which guarantees deterministic resource handling.

For more information about conduit in general, and how this package in
particular fits into the ecosystem, see [the conduit
homepage](https://github.com/snoyberg/conduit#readme).
