# Contribution Guidelines

1. Configure your project with `--enable-tests -flib-Werror`. This
   will make sure tests get built and will treat all warnings as
   errors. We are shooting for 0 warnings in this project.
2. If you are considering some major functionality, please run it by
   us in an issue first so you don't have to do a bunch of work that
   will get rejected. This project is shooting for very minimal
   dependencies and compliance with the RFC3986 spec, so we can't
   include every feature under the sun.
3. Please try to write a test if applicable.
4. Please try to write a benchmark if applicable.
5. If we forget to add you to the Contributors section of the README,
   please let us know!
